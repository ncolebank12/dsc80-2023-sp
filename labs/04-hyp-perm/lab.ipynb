    "Welcome to the fourth lab assignment in DSC 80 this quarter!\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like in DSC 10, this Jupyter Notebook contains the statements of the problems and provides code and Markdown cells to display your answers to the problems. Unlike DSC 10, the notebook is *only* for displaying a readable version of your final answers. The coding will be done in an accompanying `lab.py` file that is imported into the current notebook, and **you will only submit that `lab.py` file**, not this notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional guidelines:\n",
    "- **Unlike in DSC 10, labs will have both public tests and hidden tests.** The bulk of your grade will come from your scores on hidden tests, which you will only see on Gradescope after the assignment deadline.\n",
    "- **Do not change the function names in the `lab.py` file!** The functions in the `lab.py` file are how your assignment is graded, and they are graded by their name. If you changed something you weren't supposed to, you can find the original code in the [course GitHub repository](https://github.com/dsc-courses/dsc80-2023-wi).\n",
    "- Notebooks are nice for testing and experimenting with different implementations before designing your function in your `lab.py` file. You can write code here, but make sure that all of your real work is in the `lab.py` file, since that's all you're submitting.\n",
    "- **To ensure that all of your work to be submitted is in `lab.py`, we've provided an additional uneditable notebook, called `lab-validation.ipynb`, that contains only the tests and their setup. Make sure you are able to run it top-to-bottom without error before submitting!**\n",
    "- You are encouraged to write your own additional helper functions to solve the lab, as long as they also end up in `lab.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importing code from `lab.py`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Below, we import the `.py` file that's contained in the same directory as this notebook.\n",
    "* We use the `autoreload` notebook extension to make changes to our `lab.py` file immediately available in our notebook. Without this extension, we would need to restart the notebook kernel to see any changes to `lab.py` in the notebook.\n",
    "    - `autoreload` is necessary because, upon import, `lab.py` is compiled to bytecode (in the directory `__pycache__`). Subsequent imports of `lab` merely import the existing compiled python."

    "\n",
    "Now, you own a Toyota Highlander equipped with TritonTire tires, and you decide to test this claim. You take your car to an empty Vons parking lot, speed up to exactly 60 mph, hit the brakes, and measure the stopping distance. As illegal as it is, you repeat this process 50 times and find that **you stopped in under 106 feet only 47 of the 50 times**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Livid, you call TritonTire and say that their claim is false. They say, no, that you were just unlucky: your experiment is consistent with their claim. But they didn't realize that they are dealing with a *data scientist* üßë‚Äçüî¨.\n",
    "\n",
    "To settle the matter, you decide to unleash the power of the hypothesis test. The following three subparts ask you to answer a total of four select-all multiple choice questions.\n",

    "3. Because if we run more and more trials (where a trial is speeding up the car then stopping), the probability of finding *any* particular observed test statistic gets closer and closer to zero, so if we did this we would always reject the null with more trials even if the null is true. For example, flipping a fair coin twice means it‚Äôs pretty likely to see 50% heads, but flipping it 10000 times means it‚Äôs quite unlikely to see 50% heads.\n",

    "While your `pval_color` function used a default color of `'orange'`, it should also work for all other colors of Skittles, meaning you can run the same permutation test from Question 7 on all colors of Skittles. Call `pval_color` on all colors of Skittles to find which colors differ the most between the two locations on average. \n",

    "Then, complete the implementation of the function `ordered_colors`, which returns a list of five ordered pairs, each of the form `('color', p_value)`. For example, your list might look like `[('pink', 0.000), ('brown', 0.025), ...]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The list should be **hard-coded**, meaning that you should run your permutation tests in your notebook, not in your `.py` file. The list should also be sorted in **increasing order of p-value**. Make sure your p-values are rounded to **3 decimal places**.\n",

Set a significance level (i.e. p-value cutoff) of 0.01 and determine whether you can reject a null hypothesis that answers the question above using a permutation test with 1000 trials. For your test statistic, use the **total variation distance (TVD)**.\n",

    "Refer to [Lecture 10](https://dsc80.com/resources/lectures/lec10/lec10.html) to see an example of a [permutation test](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/12/Comparing_Two_Samples.html) that uses the [TVD](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/11/2/Multiple_Categories.html) as the test statistic. Some guidance:\n",

    "- Our previous permutation tests have compared the mean number of (say) orange Skittles in Yorkville bags to the mean number number of orange Skittles in Waco bags. The role of shuffling was to randomly assign bags to Yorkville and Waco.\n",
    "- In this permutation test, we are **still** shuffling to randomly assign bags to Yorkville and Waco. The only difference is that after we randomly assign each bag to a factory, we will compute the **distribution** of colors among the two factories and find the TVD between those two distributions.\n",
