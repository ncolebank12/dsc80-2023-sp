    "### Working on the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook contains the statements of the problems and provides code and Markdown cells to display your answers to the problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Like the lab, your coding work will be developed in the accompanying `project.py` file, that will be imported into the current notebook. This code will be autograded.\n",
    "* There is no manually-graded component to Project 2, so the only thing you will ever submit is `project.py`.\n",
    "* **For the Checkpoint, which is required, you only need to turn in a `project.py` containing solutions for Questions 1, 2, 6, 8, and 10!**\n",
    "    - The \"Project 2 Checkpoint\" autograder on Gradescope does not thoroughly check your code – it only runs the public tests on Questions 1, 2, 6, 8, and 10 to make sure that you have completed them. There are no hidden tests for the checkpoint, and you will see your score upon submission. \n",
    "    - When you submit the final version of the project, however, we will use hidden tests to check your answers more thoroughly.\n",
    "    - Note that this means you will ultimately have to submit the project twice – once to the \"Project 2 Checkpoint\" autograder (Questions 1, 2, 6, 8, and 10) and once to the \"Project 2\" autograder (once you're fully done).\n",
    "- **Do not change the function names in the `project.py` file!** The functions in the `project.py` file are how your assignment is graded, and they are graded by their name. If you changed something you weren't supposed to, you can find the original code in the [course GitHub repository](https://github.com/dsc-courses/dsc80-2023-wi).\n",
    "- **To ensure that all of your work to be submitted is in `project.py`, we've provided an additional uneditable notebook, called `project-validation.ipynb`, that contains only the tests and their setup. Make sure you are able to run it top-to-bottom without error before submitting!**\n",
    "- You are encouraged to write your own additional helper functions to solve the project, as long as they also end up in `project.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Warning! 🚨\n",
    "\n",
    "This project contains larger datasets than usual. They aren't huge, but they aren't tiny. The autograder has been set to allow more memory usage than usual, but if you write inefficient code you may exhaust all of the allocated memory, causing the autograder to fail. If this happens, the autograder will say that your submission was formatted incorrectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Writing efficient code is part of the project!** Be sure to submit your code to the Gradescope autograder regularly to check that it is efficient enough. If your code fails to run on the autograder due to efficiency reasons and it is past the late deadline, we will perform a \"catastrophic regrade\" by removing your inefficient code (deleting that function definition) and charging the usual cost of two slip days. This is expensive, so be sure to check that your code works with the autograder with plenty of time before the deadline!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with a Partner 👯\n",
    "\n",
    "You may work together on projects (and projects only!) with a partner. If you work with a partner, you are both required to actively contribute to all parts of the project. You must both be working on the assignment at the same time together, either physically or virtually on a Zoom call. You are encouraged to follow the pair programming model, in which you work on just a single computer and alternate who writes the code and who thinks about the problems at a high level.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, you **cannot** split up the project and each work on separate parts independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you do work with a partner, you and your partner must submit the Checkpoint together and the whole project together. See [here](https://dsc80.com/syllabus/#projects) for more details."

    "## Part 2: Vaccine Effectiveness 💉\n",
    "\n",
    "There has naturally been much interest in the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. In particular, recent reports suggest that the effectiveness of vaccines – and the Pfizer vaccine in particular – may decrease over time. While this is true, the public perception of declining vaccine effectiveness has been affected by what is often a poor use of statistics by media outlets.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, take the following blurb from [this article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/israel-covid-delta-variant-booster-1.6159472) on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's website (emphasis added):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Meanwhile, Israeli health officials reported what appeared to be a waning efficacy of the vaccine, including among those who had been double vaccinated. **Data showed that of the serious cases being admitted to hospital, around 60 per cent of patients were people who had been fully vaccinated**, though most were over 60 or with underlying health conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This stat sounds terrible – if you're sick in a hospital bed with COVID-19, you're actually more likely to be vaccinated than not! If you're not a data scientist, you might come away with the conclusion that the vaccine is no longer effective against serious illness, or – even worse – that getting the vaccine will **increase** your risk of sickness. Of course, this statistic by itself is actually meaningless. For instance, imagine a world in which 100% of people are vaccinated. Then 100% of people admitted to the hospital will be vaccinated, too! In Question 8, we will explain the theory behind **vaccine effectiveness**, a statistic that more meaningfully measures the improvement in outcomes for vaccinated individuals over unvaccinated individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, let's load in some data. For this project, we'll work with a dataset of vaccine effectiveness in Israel through mid-summer 2021. The vaccination and hospitalization records in the dataset are real. Israel was mostly vaccinated using the Pfizer vaccine, and was one of the first places where lots of data on the Delta variant was gathered."

    "\n",
    "As mentioned at the start of Part 2, looking at the probability of being vaccinated if you're hospitalized is meaningless, since if everyone is vaccinated, this probability will be 1. Instead, we care about **the probability of being hospitalized if you're vaccinated.** More than that, what we care most about is how this probability relates to **the probability of being hospitalized if you're unvaccinated**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it more concretely, let's say that 1 in 100 vaccinated people are hospitalized, while 10 in 100 unvaccinated people are hospitalized. This means that unvaccinated people are 10x more likely to be hospitalized than vaccinated people. To put it another way, if those 10 hospitalized unvaccinated people had been vaccinated, we'd expect that 9 of them would not have been hospitalized. That is, the vaccine would have prevented 90% of the hospitalizations, and we might therefore say that it is 90% effective against severe illness.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the intuition behind the definition of **vaccine effectiveness** (see the CDC's [page](https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson3/section6.html) for more information). That is, to compute a vaccine's effectiveness, we need to know two things:\n",

On the other hand, if the vaccine is no better than being unvaccinated, $p_V = p_U$ and the effectiveness is 0 (0%).\n",

    "Many news articles report effectiveness numbers, and this is certainly better than reporting the percentage of hospital patients that are vaccinated. Note, though, that there are different types of effectiveness – effectiveness against severe illness, effectiveness against symptomatic illness, effectiveness against death – and articles often are vague about which they are using.

We'll take a deeper look at this in the next question, but for now let's consider a slightly different scenario where we can give dosages of a vaccine on a scale, so that some people can receive more vaccine than others. We expect that the higher a dosage someone receives, the less sick they become. But suppose we plot the data and we see something like this:\n",

In this case, we don't care about overall effectiveness – we care about how effective the vaccine will be for an *individual*.

If you're told that 20% of young people are vaccinated and that 10% of young vaccinated people will be hospitalized, you know that $1000 \\cdot 0.2 \\cdot 0.1 = 20$ young vaccinated people will be hospitalized. \n",
