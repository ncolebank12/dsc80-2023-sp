    "### Working on the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook contains the statements of the problems and provides code and Markdown cells to display your answers to the problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Like the lab, your coding work will be developed in the accompanying `project.py` file, that will be imported into the current notebook. This code will be autograded.\n",
    "* There is no manually-graded component to Project 2, so the only thing you will ever submit is `project.py`.\n",
    "* **For the Checkpoint, which is required, you only need to turn in a `project.py` containing solutions for Questions 1, 2, 6, 8, and 10!**\n",
    "    - The \"Project 2 Checkpoint\" autograder on Gradescope does not thoroughly check your code – it only runs the public tests on Questions 1, 2, 6, 8, and 10 to make sure that you have completed them. There are no hidden tests for the checkpoint, and you will see your score upon submission. \n",
    "    - When you submit the final version of the project, however, we will use hidden tests to check your answers more thoroughly.\n",
    "    - Note that this means you will ultimately have to submit the project twice – once to the \"Project 2 Checkpoint\" autograder (Questions 1, 2, 6, 8, and 10) and once to the \"Project 2\" autograder (once you're fully done).\n",
    "- **Do not change the function names in the `project.py` file!** The functions in the `project.py` file are how your assignment is graded, and they are graded by their name. If you changed something you weren't supposed to, you can find the original code in the [course GitHub repository](https://github.com/dsc-courses/dsc80-2023-wi).\n",
    "- **To ensure that all of your work to be submitted is in `project.py`, we've provided an additional uneditable notebook, called `project-validation.ipynb`, that contains only the tests and their setup. Make sure you are able to run it top-to-bottom without error before submitting!**\n",
    "- You are encouraged to write your own additional helper functions to solve the project, as long as they also end up in `project.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Warning! 🚨\n",
    "\n",
    "This project contains larger datasets than usual. They aren't huge, but they aren't tiny. The autograder has been set to allow more memory usage than usual, but if you write inefficient code you may exhaust all of the allocated memory, causing the autograder to fail. If this happens, the autograder will say that your submission was formatted incorrectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Writing efficient code is part of the project!** Be sure to submit your code to the Gradescope autograder regularly to check that it is efficient enough. If your code fails to run on the autograder due to efficiency reasons and it is past the late deadline, we will perform a \"catastrophic regrade\" by removing your inefficient code (deleting that function definition) and charging the usual cost of two slip days. This is expensive, so be sure to check that your code works with the autograder with plenty of time before the deadline!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with a Partner 👯\n",
    "\n",
    "You may work together on projects (and projects only!) with a partner. If you work with a partner, you are both required to actively contribute to all parts of the project. You must both be working on the assignment at the same time together, either physically or virtually on a Zoom call. You are encouraged to follow the pair programming model, in which you work on just a single computer and alternate who writes the code and who thinks about the problems at a high level.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, you **cannot** split up the project and each work on separate parts independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you do work with a partner, you and your partner must submit the Checkpoint together and the whole project together. See [here](https://dsc80.com/syllabus/#projects) for more details."

    "Complete the implementation of the function `draw_choropleth`, which takes in a DataFrame like `tots`, and another DataFrame like `pops_fixed`, and returns a `plotly` figure object containing a [choropleth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map) of the **average number of doses per person for each country**. We define this quantity as:\n",

    "\n",
    "Here are some requirements to get full credit for your choropleth:\n",
    "- You'll need to set the `locations` appropriately to tell `plotly` which regions you'd like to plot. (You should not need to do much work for this; if you find yourself setting two arguments that contain \"location\" in the name, you will fail the autograder, so make sure to set `locations` only.)\n",
    "- Make sure the legend is labelled `'Doses Per Person'` exactly.\n",
    "- When we hover over a country, we should see the name of the `'Country (or dependency)'` in bold at the top, just like in the example below.\n",
    "- Set the color scale to be something other than the default. Note that in this choropleth, you should use a sequential color scheme, which means that the intensity of the color assigned to a country is proportional to the value being plotted for that country (e.g. darker colors should correspond to more doses per person and lighter colors should correspond to fewer doses per person, or vice versa). Read more about the theory of sequential and diverging color schemes [here](https://blog.datawrapper.de/diverging-vs-sequential-color-scales/).\n",
    "- Set the title of the plot appropriately; it's up to you what the title is, as long as it contains `'COVID Vaccine Doses Per Person'` somewhere.\n",
    "- Make sure the entire world is visible in your plot, not just a certain region.\n",
    "- **Only include countries for which we know both the total number of doses administered and the total population.**\n",

    "\n",
    "There has naturally been much interest in the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. In particular, recent reports suggest that the effectiveness of vaccines – and the Pfizer vaccine in particular – may decrease over time. While this is true, the public perception of declining vaccine effectiveness has been affected by what is often a poor use of statistics by media outlets.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, take the following blurb from [this article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/israel-covid-delta-variant-booster-1.6159472) on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's website (emphasis added):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Meanwhile, Israeli health officials reported what appeared to be a waning efficacy of the vaccine, including among those who had been double vaccinated. **Data showed that of the serious cases being admitted to hospital, around 60 per cent of patients were people who had been fully vaccinated**, though most were over 60 or with underlying health conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This stat sounds terrible – if you're sick in a hospital bed with COVID-19, you're actually more likely to be vaccinated than not! If you're not a data scientist, you might come away with the conclusion that the vaccine is no longer effective against serious illness, or – even worse – that getting the vaccine will **increase** your risk of sickness. Of course, this statistic by itself is actually meaningless. For instance, imagine a world in which 100% of people are vaccinated. Then 100% of people admitted to the hospital will be vaccinated, too! In Question 8, we will explain the theory behind **vaccine effectiveness**, a statistic that more meaningfully measures the improvement in outcomes for vaccinated individuals over unvaccinated individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, let's load in some data. For this project, we'll work with a dataset of vaccine effectiveness in Israel through mid-summer 2021. The vaccination and hospitalization records in the dataset are real. Israel was mostly vaccinated using the Pfizer vaccine, and was one of the first places where lots of data on the Delta variant was gathered."

    "\n",
    "***Note:*** Assume that \"hospitalization\" and \"severe illness\" mean the same thing; that is, if someone is hospitalized they developed severe illness and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned at the start of Part 2, looking at the probability of being vaccinated if you're hospitalized is meaningless, since if everyone is vaccinated, this probability will be 1. Instead, we care about **the probability of being hospitalized if you're vaccinated.** More than that, what we care most about is how this probability relates to **the probability of being hospitalized if you're unvaccinated**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it more concretely, let's say that 1 in 100 vaccinated people are hospitalized, while 10 in 100 unvaccinated people are hospitalized. This means that unvaccinated people are 10x more likely to be hospitalized than vaccinated people. To put it another way, if those 10 hospitalized unvaccinated people had been vaccinated, we'd expect that 9 of them would not have been hospitalized. That is, the vaccine would have prevented 90% of the hospitalizations, and we might therefore say that it is 90% effective against severe illness.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the intuition behind the definition of **vaccine effectiveness** (see the CDC's [page](https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson3/section6.html) for more information). That is, to compute a vaccine's effectiveness, we need to know two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The proportion of vaccinated people who developed severe illness (i.e., the probability that a vaccinated person will be hospitalized). Call this $p_V$.\n",
    "2. The proportion of unvaccinated people who developed severe illness (i.e., the probability that an unvaccinated person will be hospitalized). Call this $p_U$.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this formula calculates, in words, is the proportion of unvaccinated people with severe illness who we expect would not have severe illness if they were vaccinated.** For instance, if no one who is vaccinated becomes severely ill, then $p_V = 0$ and the effectiveness is 1 (100%). On the other hand, if the vaccine is no better than being unvaccinated, $p_V = p_U$ and the effectiveness is 0 (0%).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Many news articles report effectiveness numbers, and this is certainly better than reporting the percentage of hospital patients that are vaccinated. Note, though, that there are different types of effectiveness – effectiveness against severe illness, effectiveness against symptomatic illness, effectiveness against death – and articles often are vague about which they are using. But even then, effectiveness can *still* be misleading due to statistical quirks, as we'll now see.\n",

    "This is an instance of [Simpson's paradox](https://dsc80.com/resources/lectures/lec08/lec08.html#Simpson's-paradox). This result might seem strange, or even impossible – how can *every one* of the age groups see a higher effectiveness rate than the overall effectiveness rate? We'll take a deeper look at this in the next question, but for now let's consider a slightly different scenario where we can give dosages of a vaccine on a scale, so that some people can receive more vaccine than others. We expect that the higher a dosage someone receives, the less sick they become. But suppose we plot the data and we see something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./data/simpsons-aggregated.svg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "It actually looks like the more dosage someone receives, the more sick they get! But suppose we were to *disaggregate* the data into two age groups – old and young. That is, let's look at the same plot, but now mark young people as red and older people as purple. We might see this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./data/simpsons.svg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we see a different story: the larger the dosage, the less the sickness within each age group. Therefore, while the overall trend is a *positive* relationship between dosage and sickness, the within-group trends are all negative, as we'd hope. **The reason for this difference comes from the fact that, for each dosage level, the sickness rate of older people is greater than the sickness rate for younger people.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If our data gives different answers depending on how we aggregate it, which answer should we use? In this case, we don't care about overall effectiveness – we care about how effective the vaccine will be for an *individual*. The data shows that, no matter what your age, unvaccinated people are ten times as likely to develop severe illness than vaccinated people, and it shows that the vaccine's effectiveness against severe illness is still quite strong."

    "The plots above may help to understand Simpson's paradox a little bit more, but it may still be unclear how each age group's effectiveness rate can be higher than the overall effectiveness rate. To explore this in more depth, **we'll build a calculator that takes in several arguments and calculates three effectivenesses: the overall (aggregate) effectiveness, the effectiveness among young people, and the effectiveness among old people.** For simplicity, we'll assume that there are just as many old people as young people.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate these effectivenesses, you need to know six numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The proportion of young people that are vaccinated.\n",
    "2. The proportion of old people that are vaccinated.\n",
    "3. The probability that a young vaccinated person will be hospitalized.\n",

    "6. The probability that an old *un*vaccinated person will be hospitalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these six pieces of information, you can calculate the overall effectiveness, the effectiveness in young people, and the effectiveness in old people.\n",
    "\n",
    "How, you may ask? Well, to find the effectiveness in young people, you can use the effectiveness definition from [Question 8](#Question-8) ($1 - \\frac{p_V}{p_U}$) directly since you are given the probability that a young vaccinated person will be hospitalized ($p_V$, for young people) and the probability that a young unvaccinated person will be hospitalized ($p_U$, for young people). The same applies for the effectiveness in old people.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the overall effectiveness, you need to find the values of $p_V$ and $p_U$ in the overall population, given  the six arguments that `effectiveness_calculator` takes in. \n",
    "- One approach is to express all six arguments in terms of conditional probability notation and to use your knowledge of probability theory from DSC 40A. One idea to look at in particular is the law of total probability ([Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_probability), [slides from DSC 40A](https://dsc-courses.github.io/dsc40a-2021-fa/resources/lecture/lec14-filled.pdf)).\n",
    "- Another approach is to fix concrete numbers. \n",
    "    - For instance, assume that there are 1000 old people and 1000 young people (recall, we are operating under the assumption there are an equal number of old and young people, for simplicity).\n",
    "    - To calculate the probability that a vaccinated person is hospitalized, you need to know the _number_ of vaccinated people that are hospitalized in this hypothetical example. If you're told that 20% of young people are vaccinated and that 10% of young vaccinated people will be hospitalized, you know that $1000 \\cdot 0.2 \\cdot 0.1 = 20$ young vaccinated people will be hospitalized. \n",
    "    - If you're also told that 60% of old people are vaccinated and that 30% of old vaccinated people will be hospitalized, then you know that $1000 \\cdot 0.6 \\cdot 0.3 = 180$ old vaccinated people will be hospitalized.\n",
    "    - Using the above information, you know that there are $1000 \\cdot 0.2 + 1000 \\cdot 0.6 = 200 + 600 = 800$ vaccinated people total.\n",
    "    - Putting this all together, 200 of the 800 vaccinated people will be hospitalized, so the overall $p_V$ is $p_V = \\frac{200}{800} = 0.25$ in this example.\n",
    "    - You can do the same for unvaccinated people to find the overall $p_U$.\n",
    "    - Working with concrete numbers like this *is* using probability theory, just with extra steps. But it might be less abstract and easier to reason about."
